    "# 1. Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a significant relationship between life satisfaction and loneliness levels among individuals? Specifically, I want to determine if individuals with higher life satisfaction scores have lower loneliness levels, as measured by various loneliness sub-scales. This question will help us understand the potential link between overall well-being and perceived loneliness, and explore how improving oneâ€™s life satisfaction might reduce loneliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Variables and Exploration Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. WELLNESS_life_satisfaction: A continuous variable representing the overall life satisfaction of the individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score: A continuous variable representing the loneliness level of individuals based on the UCLA Loneliness Scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. LONELY_dejong_social_loneliness_sub_scale_score: A continuous variable representing social loneliness as measured by the De Jong Gierveld scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore these variables, I will perform summary statistics and visualizations to better understand the relationships. I plan to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scatter Plot: To illustrate the relationship between life satisfaction and loneliness levels, I will create scatter plots for each pair of variables. This will help visually depict if there is a negative correlation between life satisfaction and loneliness, which would be represented by a downward trend in the scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Histogram: I will use histograms to show the distribution of life satisfaction scores and loneliness scores separately, allowing us to see the overall spread, shape, and central tendencies of each variable. This will help in understanding whether the data is skewed and the typical values for each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Correlation Matrix: I will use a correlation matrix to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients between the different variables. This will help determine the strength and direction of the relationships among the variables, providing quantitative support for visual insights from the scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the research question, I plan to use the following analysis methods, with detailed steps provided for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-sample Hypothesis Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: To determine if the average life satisfaction score significantly differs from a specified value (e.g., the midpoint of the scale, indicating average satisfaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: I will use bootstrapping to create a confidence interval for the mean of the WELLNESS_life_satisfaction variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the sample mean of WELLNESS_life_satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate 1,000 bootstrap samples from the original dataset, each of the same size as the original sample, using replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compute the mean of each bootstrap sample and generate a distribution of bootstrap means.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the bootstrap distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare the confidence interval to the hypothesized value.\n",
